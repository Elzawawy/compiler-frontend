# Format of file copied form "https://docs.datree.io/docs/include-a-codeowners-file-in-your-projects"
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# So if a pull request only touches C++ files, only these owners
# will be requested to review.

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer.
