# Parser Generator

PRSGEN is  *phase 2* of a **compiler frontend pipeline**. This work is done as the project for PLT (**P**rogramming **L**anguage **T**ranslation) course at Alexandria University, Faculty of Engineering Computer and Communications Department, offered in Spring 2020.

**But, What's PARSE GEN really ?**

In our compiler model , the parser obtains a string of tokens from the lexical analyzer, and verifies that the string of token names can be generated by the grammar for the source language. We expect the parser to report any syntax errors in an intelligible fashion and to recover from commonly occurring errors to continue processing the remainder of the program.
Conceptually, for well-formed programs, the parser constructs a parse tree and passes it to the rest of the compiler for further processing.

**Goal of this phase ?**

- Aims to practice techniques for building automatic parser generator tools.
- Design and implement an LL (1) parser generator tool.

We begin the documentation of our PRSGEN by explaining the first component, the **grammar parser**, then we continue to explain the second component which is the **parsing table generator** and the third final component is the **predictive non-recursive parser**. In each component we explain what its goal and job exactly and then give a brief of how internally it works in a some what high level.

## Component One: Grammar Parser


## Component Two: Parsing Table Generator

## Component Three: Predictive Non-recursive Parser
